If you’re doing Module C Elective 2 then you’ll need to think about Alain de Botton. This guy has read a lot of books and knows just about everything there is to know about the most obscure philosophers/thinkers/writers/dudes in Europe and beyond.

His emphasis is the search for happiness and he loves to ask: ‘Why?’

He’s easy to read too – witty, insightful and thought-provoking. Like any good writer, he knows how to identify and then explore irony.

But why does he write about travel and how does he use language to represent his thoughts and ideas?
