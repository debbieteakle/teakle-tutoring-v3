Every good essay starts with a sharp, punchy thesis statement. A bold thesis statement can be defined simply as a clear statement of position (‘thesis’ means position) in response to the question. Essay questions are not there to be re-stated! Essay questions are meant to <em>provoke</em> a response – you’re meant to <em>react</em> to an essay question. A student who is provoked into a response will tend to write a bold thesis statement that immediately creates two things worth thinking about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, she or he has conveyed unashamed commitment to an argument – writing a bold thesis means you simply have to back it up now don’t you?</li>\n<li>Secondly, a bold thesis statement raises expectations in the reader (marker!) and if you <em>meet</em> those raised expectations you can expect good things will come of it. How do you meet these raised expectations? Easy – you provide good examples from the text to support your wonderful insights and ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students who respond to a question by re-wording or re-stating it might as well write: “Hello, I don’t actually have an opinion about this and that’s probably because I have not spent enough time with the texts in question. Perhaps I did spend too much time doing other things and it has caught up with me.”</p>\n<p>That is not a good way to start an essay! A bold thesis statement is.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/essays-be-bold","title":"Essays – It Pays to be Bold","author":"Mathew Teakle","date":"03 May, 2015","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/b74b1/be-bold.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/d3fc0/be-bold.jpg 270w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/19455/be-bold.jpg 540w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/b74b1/be-bold.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/ede49/be-bold.webp 270w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/4cb34/be-bold.webp 540w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/4f506/be-bold.webp 1080w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"}]},"width":1080,"height":1080}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"becad537-07fe-5a93-92d7-5dee253fdbb1"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
