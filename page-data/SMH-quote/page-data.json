I don’t get ‘inundated’ with requests like this – the journo is a nice chap – but they’re <em>his</em> words not mine. I told him I’d had requests, but always refuse. I also told him that I teach to prepare students for life beyond the HSC. The main reason I refuse to write essays is that it is simply, clearly, categorically <em>unethical</em>. The second is that to me, the HSC is like a trusty old Holden Statesman ute that’s held together by wire and duct tape and has one of those map of Australia radio antennas – it might be a little outdated and messy, but it works wonderfully. Somehow, year after year, the good ol’ HSC gets the job done.</p>\n<p>Also, did you notice that the part of this article that features my ‘contribution’ has a rather deliciously ironic grammatical problem!?</p>\n<p>Seriously though, I’m waaaaaaaay against this approach to the HSC English courses. You just need to do your best, get some help if you need it – but just do your best.</p>\n<p>What else is there?</p>\n<p>Please don’t buy essays or use other people’s work. It will only come back to haunt you later in life. Cast your mind into the future for a moment and imagine you’ve been asked to give a presentation to the boss. Now imagine you cheated in the HSC by purchasing pre-prepared essays and then regurgitated them verbatim.</p>\n<p>This is your boss’ response to your presentation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrWoG8IckyE\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrWoG8IckyE</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/SMH-quote","title":"In the news","author":"Mathew Teakle","date":"07 June, 2015","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/b74b1/newspaper.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/d3fc0/newspaper.jpg 270w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/19455/newspaper.jpg 540w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/b74b1/newspaper.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/ede49/newspaper.webp 270w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/4cb34/newspaper.webp 540w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/4f506/newspaper.webp 1080w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"}]},"width":1080,"height":1080}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fe40cdda-f032-5964-b656-747890ac8943"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
